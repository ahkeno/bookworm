# BookWorm
I create this project under 
1) re-usable components
2) Clean Code 
3) Efficient Performance by Using Angular - 6, Typescript and ES6 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.This project is start the idea of collection(GoodRead) of the books I read and quotes. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run 'npm run proxy-mock-server' for the app with JSON mock server.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng test --sourceMap=false` without sourcemaps as a workaround

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
